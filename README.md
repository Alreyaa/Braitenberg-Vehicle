# Braitenberg-Vehicle
Braitenberg vehicles is a simple version of a robot that works on reaction to stimuli in its environment. The primary behaviors of these rudimentary robots: fear, aggression, love, and explore are based on the straight or cross-connections between the two motors and sensors that elicit these excitatory or inhibitory movements.
